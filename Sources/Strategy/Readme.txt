  Strategy pattern
/******************/

**The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsualtes each one, and makes them interchangeable.
**Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

1.Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
2.Program to an interface ,not an implementation.
3.Code reusablity enhenced.
4.Favor composition over inheritance.
